This is a data processing project using Riot Games' public API endpoints to analyze player statistics for the game League of Legends. Back then, end of year summaries used to given in the game client that gave fun statistics such as number of spellcasts, total damage dealt, favorite champions, etc. The inspiration is to bring that back on a platform that can be checked throughout the year for me and my friends, and eventually, everyone. The name is a reference to the group chat my friends and I started during Covid. My best memories of playing the game came from those years and I want to honor that.
